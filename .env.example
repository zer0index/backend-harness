# Anthropic API Configuration
# Option 1: Direct Anthropic API (get key from https://console.anthropic.com/)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=KEY

# Option 2: Azure Foundry API
# To use Azure Foundry endpoints, configure these three variables:
# AZURE_FOUNDRY_API_KEY=your-azure-foundry-key
# AZURE_FOUNDRY_BASE_URL=https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/anthropic
# AZURE_FOUNDRY_MODEL_NAME=claude-sonnet-4-5  # Optional: your deployment name
#
# Note: BASE_URL should end with /anthropic (the script will normalize it automatically)
# Model name should match your Azure deployment name (not the full Anthropic model ID)
